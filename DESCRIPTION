Description: Corrects GC and mappability biases for readcounts (i.e.
        coverage) in non-overlapping windows of fixed length for single
        whole genome samples, yielding a rough estimate of copy number
        for furthur analysis.  Designed for rapid correction of high
        coverage whole genome tumour and normal samples.
